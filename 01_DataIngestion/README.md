## Data Ingestion - Document Loaders

In this section, I explored different methods for loading and ingesting data from diverse sources. The methods include:

1. **TextLoader**: 
   - Used for loading plain text files.
   - Practical for simple text data stored in `.txt` files.
   
2. **PyPDFLoader**:
   - Utilized for ingesting data from PDF documents.
   - Essential when working with text-based data from PDF sources.
   
3. **WebBaseLoader**:
   - Applied for scraping and loading data from websites.
   - Useful for gathering data from online content or web pages.
   
4. **ArxivLoader**:
   - Specialized for loading research papers from the Arxiv repository.
   - Ideal for research-oriented projects that need access to academic papers.
   
5. **WikipediaLoader**:
   - Used for fetching and loading data from Wikipedia articles.
   - Great for retrieving structured information from Wikipedia.
