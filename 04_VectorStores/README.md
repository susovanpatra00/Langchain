## Vector Stores - Storing and Querying Embeddings

In this section of the notebook, I explored techniques for storing and querying embeddings using vector databases. These vector stores allow for efficient similarity searches and retrieval of relevant data based on vector representations. The techniques I used include:

1. **FAISS**:
   - A library developed by Facebook AI for efficient similarity search. It provides scalable solutions for finding nearest neighbors in large datasets.

2. **Chroma**:
   - A high-performance vector store designed for fast and accurate storage and querying of embeddings. It is optimized for large-scale applications.
