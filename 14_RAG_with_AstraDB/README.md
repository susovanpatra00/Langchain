# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with AstraDB

This project demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using AstraDB. RAG combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge bases, enabling the model to fetch relevant information from a database, like AstraDB, to enhance its responses.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build a RAG system using AstraDB. By integrating AstraDB as the retrieval component, the system can fetch domain-specific information dynamically during the generation process, leading to more accurate and context-aware responses.
