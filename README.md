Here is a comprehensive and attractive README file for your entire repository:

**Overview**
===============

Welcome to my repository, where I have explored various projects and learning activities in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. This repository is a collection of my experiences, learnings, and accomplishments in building conversational AI applications using LangChain, Groq, and Hugging Face.

**Projects and Learning Activities**
================================

### Data Ingestion - Document Loaders

In this section, I explored different methods for loading and ingesting data from diverse sources, including text files, PDF documents, websites, Arxiv repository, and Wikipedia articles.

### Data Transformation - Document Splitters

This section covers techniques for transforming and processing ingested data, preparing it for embedding and further analysis.

### Embedding - Text to Vector Representations

In this section, I experimented with various models to convert text data into embeddings (vector representations), including OpenAI Embeddings, Ollama Embedding, and HuggingFace Embedding.

### Vector Stores - Storing and Querying Embeddings

This section demonstrates techniques for storing and querying embeddings using vector databases, including FAISS and Chroma.

### OpenAI Integration

I explored how to integrate LangChain with the OpenAI API, building and deploying a simple Generative AI application.

### Ollama Integration

I built a simple Generative AI application using LangChain and the Ollama Gemma2:2b model, integrated with the Streamlit framework for a user-friendly interface.

### LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and API Server

This section demonstrates the use of LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for building a language translation application and serving it as an API using FastAPI and LangServe.

### Conversational RAG Chatbot with LangChain

I implemented a Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using LangChain, which can answer questions based on a specific web article while maintaining conversation history across multiple sessions.

### Enhanced Q&A Chatbot

I built an Enhanced Q&A Chatbot using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with AI models in a user-friendly interface.

### RAG Document Q&A With Groq and Llama3

I created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer questions based on a collection of PDF documents, utilizing Groq's API with the Llama3 model for generating accurate responses strictly based on the provided context.

### Conversational RAG with PDF Uploads and Chat History

I developed a web-based application that allows users to interactively chat with the content of uploaded PDF files, leveraging LangChain, Groq, and Hugging Face embeddings to create a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that provides contextual answers based on the content of the uploaded documents.
