**Overview**
================

This repository is a collection of projects and learning activities that I have explored and implemented using LangChain, a powerful platform for building language model applications. The projects range from data ingestion and transformation to embedding and vector stores, and finally, to conversational RAG systems and GitHub README generators. Throughout this journey, I have gained valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LangChain and its various components.

**Projects and Learning Activities**
=====================================

### Data Ingestion - Document Loaders

In this section, I explored different methods for loading and ingesting data from diverse sources using LangChain's document loaders. The loaders include TextLoader, PyPDFLoader, WebBaseLoader, ArxivLoader, and WikipediaLoader.

### Data Transformation - Document Splitters

I learned about various techniques for transforming and processing ingested data using LangChain's document splitters, including RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, CharacterTextSplitter, HTMLTextSplitter, and RecursiveJsonSplitter.

### Embedding - Text to Vector Representations

In this section, I experimented with different models for converting text data into embeddings using LangChain's embedding models, such as OpenAI Embeddings, Ollama Embedding, and HuggingFace Embedding.

### Vector Stores - Storing and Querying Embeddings

I explored techniques for storing and querying embeddings using LangChain's vector stores, including FAISS and Chroma.

### OpenAI Integration

I integrated LangChain with the OpenAI API to build and deploy a simple Generative AI application, utilizing components like LangSmith and LangServe.

### Ollama Integration

I built a simple Generative AI application using LangChain and the Ollama Gemma2:2b model, integrated with the Streamlit framework for a user-friendly interface.

### LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and API Server

I demonstrated the use of LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for building a language translation application and serving it as an API using FastAPI and LangServe.

### Conversational RAG Chatbot with LangChain

I implemented a Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using LangChain, which can answer questions based on a specific web article while maintaining conversation history across multiple sessions.

### Enhanced Q&A Chatbot

I developed an "Enhanced Q&A Chatbot" that leverages various open-source language models through the OllamaLLM integration, allowing users to interact with AI models in a user-friendly interface.

### RAG Document Q&A With Groq and Llama3

I built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer questions based on a collection of PDF documents, utilizing Groq's API with the Llama3 model for generating accurate responses strictly based on the provided context.

### Conversational RAG with PDF Uploads and Chat History

I created a web-based application that allows users to interactively chat with the content of uploaded PDF files, leveraging LangChain, Groq, and Hugging Face embeddings to create a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that provides contextual answers based on the content of the uploaded documents.

### GitHub README Generator with Langchain and Groq

I developed a GitHub README generator that integrates LangChain and Groq to automatically generate a comprehensive README.md file for a GitHub repository.

**Key Learnings and Accomplishments**
=====================================

Throughout these projects, I gained hands-on experience with LangChain's various components, including document loaders, splitters, embedding models, vector stores, and API servers. I also learned about the integration of LangChain with other platforms and models, such as OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, and Hugging Face. Additionally, I developed skills in prompt engineering, chatbot development, and conversational RAG systems.
