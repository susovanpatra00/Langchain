**Overview**

This repository is a collection of projects and learning activities that I have explored and learned by myself. The projects cover various topics in natural language processing, language models, and conversational AI. I have used LangChain, a Python library for building language model chains, to create different applications and interfaces for interacting with language models.

**Projects and Learning Activities**

The repository contains several projects and learning activities, including:

1. **Data Ingestion - Document Loaders**: Exploring different methods for loading and ingesting data from diverse sources, including text files, PDF documents, websites, and research papers.
2. **Data Transformation - Document Splitters**: Learning techniques for transforming and processing ingested data, including recursive character text splitting, character text splitting, HTML text splitting, and JSON splitting.
3. **Embedding - Text to Vector Representations**: Experimenting with various models to convert text data into embeddings, including OpenAI embeddings, Ollama embeddings, and HuggingFace embeddings.
4. **Vector Stores - Storing and Querying Embeddings**: Exploring techniques for storing and querying embeddings using vector databases, including FAISS and Chroma.
5. **OpenAI Integration**: Integrating LangChain with the OpenAI API to build a simple generative AI application.
6. **Ollama Integration**: Building a simple generative AI application using LangChain and the Ollama Gemma2:2b model, integrated with the Streamlit framework.
7. **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and API Server**: Using LCEL to build a language translation application and serving it as an API using FastAPI and LangServe.
8. **Conversational RAG Chatbot with LangChain**: Implementing a conversational RAG chatbot using LangChain, which can answer questions based on a specific web article while maintaining conversation history across multiple sessions.
9. **Enhanced Q&A Chatbot**: Building an enhanced Q&A chatbot using LangChain, OllamaLLM, and Streamlit, which allows users to interact with AI models in a user-friendly interface.
10. **RAG Document Q&A With Groq and Llama3**: Creating a RAG system that answers questions based on a collection of PDF documents using LangChain, Groq API, and Hugging Face embeddings.
11. **Conversational RAG with PDF Uploads and Chat History**: Developing a web-based application that allows users to interactively chat with the content of uploaded PDF files, using LangChain, Groq API, and Hugging Face embeddings.
