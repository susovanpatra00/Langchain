**Overview**
================================

This repository is a collection of projects and learning activities that I have completed to gain hands-on experience with various technologies and tools. The projects range from data ingestion and transformation to natural language processing and machine learning. I have explored different libraries and frameworks, including LangChain, OpenAI, and Hugging Face, to build applications that demonstrate my understanding of these technologies.

**Projects and Learning Activities**
------------------------------------

### Data Ingestion - Document Loaders

*   Explored different methods for loading and ingesting data from diverse sources, including text files, PDF documents, web pages, research papers, and Wikipedia articles.
*   Utilized various loaders, such as TextLoader, PyPDFLoader, WebBaseLoader, ArxivLoader, and WikipediaLoader.

### Data Transformation - Document Splitters

*   Learned techniques for transforming and processing ingested data, preparing it for embedding and further analysis.
*   Implemented different splitters, including RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, CharacterTextSplitter, HTMLTextSplitter, and RecursiveJsonSplitter.

### Embedding - Text to Vector Representations

*   Experimented with various models to convert text data into embeddings (vector representations) using OpenAI Embeddings, Ollama Embedding, and HuggingFace Embedding.

### Vector Stores - Storing and Querying Embeddings

*   Explored techniques for storing and querying embeddings using vector databases, including FAISS and Chroma.

### OpenAI

*   Integrated LangChain with the OpenAI API to build and deploy a simple Generative AI application.

### Ollama

*   Built a simple Generative AI application using LangChain and the Ollama Gemma2:2b model, integrated with the Streamlit framework for a user-friendly interface.

### LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and API Server

*   Demonstrated the use of LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for building a language translation application and serving it as an API using FastAPI and LangServe.

### Conversational RAG Chatbot with LangChain

*   Implemented a Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using LangChain, which can answer questions based on a specific web article while maintaining conversation history across multiple sessions.

### Enhanced Q\&A Chatbot

*   Developed a Streamlit application that is an "Enhanced Q\&A Chatbot" leveraging various open-source language models through the OllamaLLM integration.

### RAG Document Q\&A With Groq and Llama3

*   Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, Groq, and Hugging Face embeddings to answer questions based on a collection of PDF documents.

### Conversational RAG with PDF Uploads and Chat History

*   Created a web-based application that allows users to interactively chat with the content of uploaded PDF files using LangChain, Groq, and Hugging Face embeddings.

### GitHub README Generator with Langchain and Groq

*   Demonstrated the integration of LangChain and Groq to generate a comprehensive GitHub README.md file.

### Text Summarization with LangChain

*   Explored different methods for combining documents and generating summaries using language models.
