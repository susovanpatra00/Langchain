# Text Summarization with LangChain

This project demonstrates how to perform text summarization using the LangChain framework. The notebook explores different methods for combining documents and generating summaries using language models.I did this as a learning exercise to understand how to implement text summarization using LangChain. The notebook covers the use of different summarization chains and techniques to refine summaries of provided texts.

## Methods
The notebook utilizes the following key methods from the LangChain framework:
- **`load_summarize_chain`**: This function is used to load a summarization chain. It supports three types of chains:
  - `stuff`: A straightforward approach that combines documents and summarizes them in one go.
  - `map_reduce`: A method that first summarizes individual documents and then combines these summaries into a final summary.
  - `refine`: An iterative approach that refines an existing summary based on new information.

Each method is tested with a given text, and the results are compared to understand their effectiveness.

## Conclusion
This project serves as an introduction to text summarization using LangChain, showcasing different summarization techniques. It provides a foundation for further experimentation with text processing and summarization tasks using advanced language models.
