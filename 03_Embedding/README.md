## Embedding - Text to Vector Representations

In this section of the notebook, I experimented with various models to convert text data into embeddings (vector representations). These embeddings are crucial for tasks like similarity search, clustering, and other machine learning applications. The models explored include:

1. **OpenAI Embeddings**:
   - Leverages OpenAI's models to create embeddings from text data, known for their robustness and accuracy.

2. **Ollama Embedding**:
   - A model used for generating embeddings, often optimized for specific tasks or datasets.

3. **HuggingFace Embedding**:
   - Utilizes the HuggingFace library, which provides access to a wide range of pre-trained models for generating embeddings, allowing flexibility based on the task at hand.
